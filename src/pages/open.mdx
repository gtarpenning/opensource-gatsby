## Open Source vs. Free Software

- Term coined in 1998 in Palo Alto
- Companies actively attacked “free software” (can’t imagine why), “open” was seen as less threatening

#### Examples of OS licenses:
- Apache License 2.0
- GNU General Public License (GPL)
- MIT license
- Mozilla Public License 2.0

#### “allow software to be freely used, modified, and shared” - [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/)

All Open Source code can be taken and SOLD in any capacity, however, all modifications must also be published under the same license...

## Proprietary, but open source…?

[Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is an example of a technically open source project, 
that also contains proprietary code. This distinction is the fundamental difference between free software 
and open source! Open source merely requires the distrobution of source code, while the free software 
movement requires all code to be usable and extendable without limit. Microsoft, with Visual Studio, 
walks a very thin line where they have made open source only the elements of the code that *must* be open 
(as per the license of use of those underlying code bits), but has hidden away proprietary code that builds
off of it. Their lawyers might say that the MS proprietary code is merely running "in parallel" or some
other arbitrary distinction to get around the MIT license requirements...
